# pyautoarima
Automatic time series forecasting using ARIMA family models. 
Implementing the Auto-ARIMA in python and creating a robust algorithm to handle any type of series for forecasting. Automatically chooses the best model for forecasting
Additional Features above the basic auto-ARIMA algorithms,
1. Handling Long Seasonalities
2. Handling multiple Seasonalities
3. Accepting Holiday feature and using it as an exogenous feature

Future scope:
1. Implement corss-validation while model building
2. Consider change-points in the time series to improve the forecasting accuracy.
